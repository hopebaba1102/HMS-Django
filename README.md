## Drawbacks/LoopHoles
- Any one can be Admin. There is no Approval required for admin account. So you can disable admin signup process and use any logic like creating superuser.
- There should be at least one doctor in hospital before admitting patient. So first add doctor.
- On update page of doctor/patient you must have to update password.
